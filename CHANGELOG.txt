Version 2.2.1 [2010/04/11]
- NEW: Initial implementation of polygon Geozones.  In the active MapProvider, set 
       the "zone.map.polygon" property to "true".  Currently only implemented for 
       "openLayers", "virtualEarth", and "googleMaps", with differing levels of 
       support. (Note: this is still experimental, so do expect some bugs).
- NEW: Geozone areas now support color selection.
- NEW: Speed reports now adjusts to "Speed Unit" settings on Account Admin page.
- NEW: Added several additional status codes.
- NEW: Additional columns added to the Device table.
- NEW: Setting a Device "Active" state to "No" now removes it from the device 
       selection list on maps and reports (in addition to still ignoring any new
       events which may arrive at the server for the device).

       the Property "deviceInfo.showDisplayColor" to false in the "private.xml" file.
- NEW: "Password" field can now be hidden on login page (for applications where only
       an account-id is needed).  See "showPassword" attribute on "Domain" tag in
       'private.xml'
- NEW: Added "Driver Admin" page.  This page is commented/disabled by default.  To
       enable this page, edit 'private.xml' and uncomment the "Page" tag that defines
       the "DriverInfo" page entry.

Version 2.2.0 [2010/01/29]
- NEW: Greek language localization (many thanks to Christos Prassas).
- NEW: Added a new web-interface look with an example banner image (white).  To change
       back to the previous traditional look, in the "custom.conf" file, set the 
       property "Domain.WebPages.JSP" to "default".
- NEW: Enabled graphical "Group Pushpin ID" selection on Device Admin page by default.  
       Can be disabled in 'private.xml' with property "deviceInfo.showPushpinChooser".
- NEW: Added "Driver" table (web-interface component not yet available).
- NEW: Added additional methods to 'RuleFactory.java' interface.
- FIX: Fixed a mapping datapoint update issue that could show improper pushpin indexes

       this feature set the "deviceInfo.showPushpinChooser" property to "true" in the
       'private.xml' file.
- NEW: Added a new Calendar action 'popup' to the From/To calendar actions on the Map
       pages.  The Calendar action can be specified in 'private.xml' on the property 
       "trackMap.calendarAction".  Valid values are "fixed", "fade" and "popup".  
       Report menu calendars are currently only available as "fixed".
- UPD: Improved DeviceChooser popup performance on IE.  Enable or disable by setting  
       the 'private.xml' file property "deviceChooser.useTable" to 'true', or 'false'.
- UPD: Romanian localization update (thanks to Mihai Csaky).
- CHG: The runtime config property "PasswordHandler.class" is now commented by 
       default.  This property was set to "md5" which creates MD5 checksum encoded
       passwords to be set in the database, instead of clear-text password.  
       Commenting this propery will again allow clear text passwords into the
       'password' field of the Account and User tables, but those that have MD5
       encoded passwords will need to be reset.
- CHG: The default value for the 'private.xml' property "reportMenu.enableReportEmail"
       is now "false".  Configure outbound SMTP and set this property to "true" to
       enable the "EMail" option when generating reports.  'CheckInstall' now also
       checks for proper SMTP configuration when this property is set 'true'.

       pushpin has landed in the Geozone (MapProvider property "map.includeGeozones"
       must be set 'true' in 'private.xml').
- NEW: Added route directional arrows to GoogleMaps implementaiton (thanks to
       Juan Carlos Argueta).  See the property "map.routeLine.arrows" in the 
       'private.xml' file for information regarding enabling this features.
- NEW: Added an "Email" option to the report output selection.  This allows emailing
       a report to the currently logged-in users contact email address.
- NEW: Added Device table columns "expectAck", "lastAckCommand", and "lastAckTime".
       Used for custom applications that require an ACK from the tracking device.

       data packet format for server-to=server event data tranfers.
- NEW: Added "${locale}" substitution key replace variable option to the "Link" tag 
       URL in the 'private.xml' file (in the "WebPages" section).
- NEW: "maxPingCount" and "dcsConfigMask" columns added to Device/Transport tables.
       (Make sure you update your tables with "bin/dbAdmin.pl -tables=ca").
- CHG: Table-based device 'chooser' now enabled by default on map and reports.  
       Columns on 'chooser' popup are now sortable.
- CHG: RuleAction and RuleFactory interfaces changed to return the action-mask for
       triggered rules (previously rule trigger would simply return true/false).
- FIX: Fixed simulated Geozone transitions when adjacent events are in different

       Communication Server configuration is now specified in an XML file, which now
       allows for a more granular type of configuration (see 'dcserver.xml').
- CHG: "New Account" button on login page is now desabled by default.  To re-enable
       modify 'privatel.xml' and uncomment "NewAccount" page definition.
- CHG: Minor changes (method additions) to Payload.java
- CHG: Added "&oe=utf8" to Google reverse-geocode URL (thanks to Gonzalo Tirado).
- FIX: Fixed various fleet/group report maps that incorrectly displayed a "route" line
       connecting the pushpins.
- FIX: Device/DeviceGroup pulldown selection on maps now sorts entries by the
       description (when only description is displayed).

Version 2.0.2 [2008/10/16]
- NEW: Updated internal OpenLayers support with initial support for GeoServer.  See
       the "geoServer" MapProvider section in 'private.xml' for more information.
       (Special thanks to Assaad Mouawad for his research and help).
- NEW: Added support for expandable menu groups on the main menu.  Enable this feature
       in the 'private.xml' file by setting the property value for the key
       "topMenu.enableExpandableMenus" to "true".

Version 2.0.1 [2008/09/19]
- NEW: A new auto-update recentering mode has been added which allows recentering
       without rezooming.
- NEW: Added column 'defaultUser' to Account table to allow specifying a per-Account
       default login user (when login 'User' field is blank).  A general default login
       user can also be specified in the 'private.xml' file, tag "DefaultLoginUser".
- NEW: Added yellow icons/pushpins with directional arrows.  A new JavaScript icon
       selector function "evHeadingYellowURL" has been added, which can return the 
       appropriate icon selection based on the direction of travel for a given event.
- NEW: For a given user, the first displayed screen after login can now be specified
       (the current options are main menu, device map, or fleet map).
- NEW: Added an overflow indication on the device map screen to indicate when the
       maximum number of pushpins allowed on the map has been exceeded (the maximum
       number of allowed pushpins for a MapProvider is specified by the property
       "map.maxPushpins" in the file 'private.xml').
- NEW: When creating custom status code descriptions, remove the test for 'invalid'
       status codes from the 'StatusCode' table command-line admin tool.  This allows
       easier creation of customized status codes for specific applications.

- CHG: Changed the "Last" point update feature to behave similar to "Update", but only
       show the last location within the specified date range.  The update "Last" 
       button display is controlled by the "trackMap.showUpdateLast" property in the
       file 'private.xml'. (This replaces the "trackMap.showLastLocation" feature)
- FIX: Fixed overflow indicator condition on reports when the number of displayed
       data records would exceed the maximum allowed records as specified in the
       'reports.xml' file.
- FIX: Empty MenuBar tabs that contain no selectable options (as set by the users 
       ACL) will no longer be displayed.

Version 1.9.8 [2008/09/12]
- NEW: Added new MaprProvider properties "iconSelector.fleet.legend" and
       "iconSelector.legend" to provide the ability to add an icon 'legend' to the
       TrackMap page.  This legend is specified as html in the specific MapProvider
       in the 'private.xml' file, and is currently not separately localizable.  Any
       desired localization must occur in the 'private.xml' file within the icon
       legend properties.
- NEW: The Timezone selection can be hidden from the TrackMap page via the Domain
       property "trackMap.showTimezoneSelection" in the 'private.xml' file.  The 
       default value is 'true'.
- NEW: Added new map option to zoom in and display only the last point.  The vehicle
       route is still displayed, but only the last pushpin is visible on the map.
       This feature has may have limited utility for most applications, so the 
       default is 'false'.  This feature can be enabled via the Domain property
       "trackMap.showLastLocation" in the 'private.xml' file.
- NEW: Added the ability to set the default login user name when the user field is
       left blank (previously 'admin' was the only possible default login user).
       This is set using the "DefaultLoginUser" tag in 'private.xml'.
- NEW: Added optional fields to EventData table: FLD_satelliteCount, FLD_batteryLevel
- CHG: "Replay" button changed to a generic icon showing options for play, continue,
       and pause. (supported for OpenLayers, Virtual Earth, and Google Maps).

       changed to include "maximum" and "default" access level attributes.
- CHG: Added bounding-box fields ("minLatitude", "maxLatitude", "minLongitude", 
       "maxLongitude") to Geozone table, optimizing lookups. (Existing Geozones
       will need to be "re-saved" to update the 'bounding-box' information.)
- CHG: Increased maximum Geozone size to 30000 meters.
- CHG: Map "AutoUpdate" now recenters the map on updates.

       displayed to the right of the map.

Version 1.9.1 [2008/07/27]
- NEW: Added a new "Pushpins" tag to the "MapProvider" section in 'private.xml' to 
       allow overriding the pushpin icons displayed on a map.  Specific static icons
       images may be specified, or custom icon URL references may be generated on 
       the fly within the Javascript code.  Additional modifications integrated to 
       allow a 'RuleFactory' implementation to determine which pushpins are to be 
       displayed for which event types (based on an "iconSelector").
       See the Pushpins section in 'private.xml' for details.
- NEW: Included several pushpins in the 'track.war' created using the "Marker Maker"
       tool supllied by GMapLive at "http://www.gmaplive.com/marker_maker_old.php".

Version 1.9.0 [2008/07/21]
- NEW: The 'PageDescorations' tag in 'private.xml' is now obsolete.  This section
       in the 'private.xml' file has been replaced with a 'jsp' attribute on the
       'WebPages' and 'Page' tages which allow using a defined JSP to create the
       page look and feel.  This specified JSP file now creates the formatting and
       look-and-feel for the webpage.  The components of the webpage (menus, maps,
       reports, etc) are referenced via taglib entries within the JSP file. 
       (If you have customized PageDecorations in your existing 'private.xml' file, 
       it will be necessary to migrate these customizations to a custom .jsp file, 
       using the provided "war/track/jsp/loginSession.jsp" as a template).
- NEW: A 'distance' ruler has been added to the Microsoft Virtual Earth map. Right-
       click and drag to view the 'distance' ruler.  Eventually, a similar feature
